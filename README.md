# FeynnLabs-ML-internship
This repository contains the projects I worked on during my machine learning internship at Feynn Labs. Each project showcases different aspects of machine learning, data analysis, and AI product development.

## Projects Overview

## Project 1:

### AI Product Ideation : 
This project focuses on generating innovative AI product ideas. It involves identifying potential AI-driven solutions, conducting feasibility analysis, and proposing a roadmap for development.

## Project 2: 

### 2.1 consists of study task case study on Market segment analysis
### 2.2 One real world Market Segment analysis

## 2.1:
#### Segmentation Study: A deep dive into segmentation techniques, exploring various methodologies and their applications in market analysis and customer profiling.

#### McDonald's Case Study: A detailed case study on McDonald's, analyzing its market segmentation strategies, customer behavior, and how data-driven insights can optimize business operations.
Each project folder contains detailed documentation, code, and relevant resources that demonstrate my learning and contributions during the internship.

## 2.2:
### Market Segment Analysis on EV Cars in India
#### Project Objectives:
Analyze market segments of electric vehicles (EVs) in India.
Utilize machine learning algorithms, particularly K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering, to identify consumer groups.
Gain insights into factors influencing EV adoption, such as income levels, geographical location, and environmental awareness.
#### Key Findings:
Effective segmentation of consumers based on preferences and behaviors.
Identification of key variables for optimal market segmentation: income level, geographical location, environmental attitudes, and vehicle type preference.
#### Future Improvements:
Collect more comprehensive datasets, including demographic and behavioral data.
Experiment with additional machine learning models, such as Random Forests and Neural Networks.

## Project 3: Financial Modelling
For this project I performed Business Modelling for the AI product idea of VirtuFurnish proposed in Project 1. This model included various aspects like The actual Business Model, The revenue Streams for VirtuFurnish and the Financial Equations.
